__"MCV"s are very similar to dashboards, so these design guidelines are worth consideration.__

__From Mike's list. Demonstrates how ontology can be used to organize complex domains and propogate existing visualizations. Here, dashboards are used as a summary or a landing page for the individual generated vis.__

__Similarly to [4], the paper presents a method of automatically aligning the encodings of related vis on a dashboard, aimed at non-designer dashboard creators. It also includes a thorough list to classify how two vis on a dashboard may be related (or not related).__
