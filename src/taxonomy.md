**I'm fairly sure I've read this one before, but as it's never been added to my Zotero before I'm placing it here. Regarding our current project, I found its definitions of design, design space, and evaluation (all on pg 2) helpful to my understanding of the terms and how they relate to each other.**

**Translates hierarchical taxonomies to grammars and maps terminals in the grammar to logged user interactions. Evaluates the selected taxonomies themselves, sorting by interaction level. Discusses both the pros and cons of each level, and how a low-level and high-level vis taxonomy can classify the same interaction.**

**As the title states, an example of an existing taxonomy based on Adrienko's task framework. I primarily reference this paper as an example of a solid argument for the taxonomy's existence.**

**This paper generates a taxonomy based on a survey of existing literature, while recognizing that the literature is currently limited. Due to this I did not find the paper convincing, except as an argument for more research into cognitive bias in vis. I did find some value in examining the reasoning shown, but your mileage may vary.**

**Both a taxonomy and an introduction of new visualization techniques (that are included in the taxonomy). Given that the visualizations used as examples involved many unfamiliar glyphs and high-dimensional datasets, I do not fully understand this paper's proposed taxonomy and am not sure if taking the time to comprehend it would be useful for this project.**

**Another example of a taxonomy based on tasks and specific design elements. Interestingly, many examples included in the paper are also compound vis. Also, one reason mentioned for creating the taxonomy was to aid API design via a vis grammar - the first time I encountered it.**

**A taxonomy of design and layout patterns in multiple view visualizations. While I am not using any of these metrics in my taxonomy, it may be interesting to compare these patterns to purpose classifications. Also includes a collection of hundreds of compound vis.**

**"External labels" refers to textual annotations that do not overlap the main visualization. This domain is very specific and granular, but there is (to my surprise) a not insignificant body of research on it. Similar to my taxonomy and others on the list, this paper ultimately serves to provide and justify a set of guidelines, with the understanding that different designers have different criteria for 'good' visualization.**

**A tool for creating hierarchical taxonomies out of variable sets. The definition of taxonomy used here is different from, but not contradictory to, those in other papers on this page. Uses word embeddings to sort terms, which is interesting but not currently relevant to the project.**

**Dataset here: https://visimages.github.io/. Over 12,000 images classified by chart type(s) and annotated by humans.The dataset is valuable and easy to search; my primary takeaway from the paper itself was its description of the annotation process in section 4.**

**Apparently, what makes a visualization memorable is chart junk. I was interested in viewing the full taxonomy, but have not yet able to locate the supplementals online. What is included in the paper is a simple MassVis-style chart type taxonomy with a few other categories related to visual design.**
